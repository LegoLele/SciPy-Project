## **Scientific Programming in Python - Chat Analyzer**

### The project is designed to analyze WhatsApp chat.

#### Features

1. **Read and Preprocess Data**: The `read_data` function reads WhatsApp chat data from a text file, extracts relevant information, and converts it into a DataFrame for further analysis.

2. **Text Analysis**: The `text_analysis` function performs various text analysis methods on the chat data, such as identifying the most active and least active hours, authors, and the most frequently used emoji.

3. **User Activity Heatmap**: The `activity_heatmap` function generates a heatmap that displays user activity based on the number of messages sent by each user during different hours of the day.

4. **ARIMA-based Prediction**: The `predict_chat_messages` function utilizes the ARIMA model to predict future chat message counts, helping to anticipate message patterns.
